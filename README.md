# Updated-Portfolio
Welcome to my 'work-in-progress' professional portfolio! The purpose of this particular repository is to continue to polish a working portfolio to include new projects completed in class and within groups. As of right now, my portfolio consists of a simple design showcasing my name with my profile picture as well as an updated view of the projects I have been working on for the duration of my coding Bootcamp course. I included working links to my Instgram, LinkedIn, and Github. I have also included a downloadable PDF file of my resume showcasing my front end and back end skills. Although everything is still a work in progress, I will continue to add more projects as I strengthen my skills.
